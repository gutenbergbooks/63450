Physical Culture will be required of all students. Hygiene is prescribed
for all girls in the second year.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pupils preparing to enter one of the California State Normal
Schools are advised to register for Course I or Course II.</p>

<p class='c009'>Note 1. The University of California will accept either Ancient
or Modern Languages or both for admission. But since the University
requires Latin for graduation from the Colleges of Letters and
Social Sciences, and does not offer instruction in the first two years
of high school Latin, students preparing to enter these Colleges must
take at least two years of Latin. Latin is not required for admission
to or graduation from other colleges.</p>

<p class='c009'>Note 2. In the General Course, Third Year English will be required
of all students who do not take at least two years of Foreign
Language.</p>

<p class='c009'>Note 3. One year of Science is required for graduation from
the General Course. It may be taken in any year of the course.</p>

<p class='c009'>Note 4. In electing Sciences and Music, students may choose
electives from the preceding or succeeding year as well as from
electives for the year in which the student is registered. General
Science, if taken, must precede any other science. One year science
will be required for graduation from any four-year course.</p>

<p class='c009'>Note 5. A student will not be allowed to take more than the
equivalent of four recitations per day unless by special agreement between
the principal and the student’s parents.</p>

<p class='c009'>Note 6. Except as provided in Note 7, sixteen credits, each requiring
at least two forty-five-minute periods per day for recitations
and preparation for one year will be required for graduation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Note 7. One of the sixteen credits required under Note 6 will
be granted for work in literary, athletic or other student activities
(including debating, and choral and orchestral music) in student societies
operating under the supervision of the principal or some faculty
member designated by him. This credit shall be granted under
rules established by the principal.</p>

<p class='c009'>Note 8. No class shall be organized or maintained in the first
or second year of any high school unless at the beginning of the year
there shall be enrolled in the class not less than twenty-five students,
provided that in the second year a course, which is a continuance of
a first year course, may be maintained if not less than twenty students
are enrolled therein.</p>

<p class='c009'>Note 9. No class shall be organized or maintained in the third
or fourth year of any high school unless at the beginning of the year
there shall be enrolled in the class not less than fifteen students, provided
that no class shall be suspended unless the same subject is being
given in some other high school in this city.</p>

<p class='c009'>1. Read for interest in story and character. Never lose sight of
this.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Work to develop the pictorial imagination. The method of
the drama will help; i. e., set the scene, describe accurately the
actors, dress them appropriately, imagine facial expression, tone of
voice, gesture and action.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Stimulate discussion on characters and motives actuating
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Occasional close work on fine descriptive passages. Image
them accurately. Bring out by this effort the obvious differences
between poetic and prose diction, but no special study of this here.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Connect with the preceding term’s work when possible, by
comparison of the heroic ideals with those of the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c013'>Second Group.</p>

<p class='c009'>Follow the general trend of the suggestions given in the text.
The aim is to arouse an interest in prose devoid of strong story element.</p>

<p class='c013'>Third Group.</p>

alliteration), and give a drill on various selections to train
the ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. “Vision of Sir Launfal.” Study for beauty of thought, ethical
content and its application to modern life, and beauty of pictures
and figures. Give much attention to the visualizing power.
Try to show that the poetic language and form are a gain.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Study of other narratives on same general plan. If time permit,
study a few lyrics rich in content and poetic beauty, such as

<p class='c009'>6. “Merchant of Venice.” Study (1) for what happens—the
sequence of events and their relation to each other; (2) for a knowledge
of the characters and the motives actuating them; (3) for fine
lines; (4) for strongest and most beautiful scenes; (5) for beauty of
language, noting scenes richest in poetic expression and its appropriateness;
(6) for structure; i.e., the major and minor stories and
their relation to each other. Throughout the whole emphasize the
fact that the play is a picture of human life; make the characters
and the scenes real.</p>

knowing the real significance of the words used.</p>

interests, the threads of action, character groups, character
contrast, the division in the plot, the important moments—but never
emphasize technique at the expense of study of the play as a picture
of life. Much memorizing of fine lines.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Prose. (1) Find main thought of each paragraph (topic sentence)
and trace its growth, noting the method of development when
clear; (2) group related paragraphs and note relation of different
groups to each other; (3) note introductory, transitional, summarizing
and concluding paragraphs; (4) show further the necessity for a
clear, definite content for each word and a knowledge of references.
Owing to the difficulty of this work, it is well at first for teachers
to study with the class, in order to arouse interest in the thought
and prevent discouragement. Power to work independently will soon
grow.</p>

and an appreciation of the gain from beautiful expression.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The novel. (1) Train in open-eyed reading; the story and the
characters should be known thoroughly. (2) Aim to enlarge the
experience by acquaintance with new motives and actions. (3) Seek
for the underlying ideas in the story and for the working out of
great laws. (4) Study of structure as in the drama.</p>

Distinguish between narrative, descriptive, and expository paragraphs,
and the methods of development in each. Begin the study of prose
style; i.e., rhetorical sentences and their value: studiously long and
short sentences, periodic sentences, antithesis and climax; also
study vocabulary, especially, in Macaulay, the use of concrete terms
and their value. Select striking paragraphs for close work on style,
and study to discover method.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Method.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>The course is to be taught historically, by means of lectures, class
study of the most important authors, and much collateral reading.
The purpose is to arouse an interest and pride in America’s literary
product, therefore the work is taught more broadly than in preceding
terms. Preface the course with a brief consideration of what is
meant by the term literature, and with a review of simple poetics
as a basis for the future study of poetry.</p>

<p class='c009'>1. Poetry. Select for study poems not usually read in the
grammar school, unless the well known have a content of growing
interest; examples: Longfellow’s Keramos, Amalfi, Morituri Salutamis;
Lowell’s Commemoration Ode; Emerson’s Each and All.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The novel. Same plan as in preceding term.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The short story. Develop (1) the characteristics of a successful
short story; (2) the differences between this and a novel;
(3) the various types of short story; (4) some definite standards of
judgment for future use.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The essay. Read mainly to stimulate thought on life.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Make the collateral reading an important part of this course.
Have outside reading done on each author studied and on others for
whom there is not time for class work. Help toward intelligent, appreciative
reading by assigning special topics on the literature read,
and give occasional recitation periods to oral reports.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Have occasional oral readings from authors not studied in
class, especially the best of the later poets. This may be done frequently
in five-minute exercises at the beginning of the recitations.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Put early into the hands of the students a classified list of
the best American authors. Stimulate in every possible way the
desire to read.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Method.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>In general study broadly to stimulate a desire for further acquaintance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>with literature, but whenever made possible by the work
in hand, review and sum up principles emphasized throughout preceding
terms.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Chaucer.</b> Read (1) for a picture of the times; (2) to discover
his broad humanity; (3) for his humor and satire; (4) for his literary
method. Do not attempt to teach pronunciation or grammar,
but insist on smooth, intelligent translation.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>The Ballads.</b> Read to find the characteristics of ballad literature.
Compare with the literary ballad; such as, The Ancient Mariner,
Scott’s Rosabelle, or Rossetti’s White Ship.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Macbeth.</b> Read principally for great ethical lessons. Emphasize
character development. Have only so much close study as is necessary
for the understanding of the action and characters. Teach as
dramatically as possible; imagine stage setting, tone of voice, facial
and bodily expression, action—in order to enter into the play. Select
passages noticeable for beauty or power of expression and test
appropriateness.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Paradise Lost.</b> Study as dramatically as possible. Do no line-by-line
study. Get the story, the character of Satan with its mixture
of good and evil, the fine pictures and imagery. Mark fine
thoughts, also examples of loftiness and sublimity, of color and splendor,
and of varying melody.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Comus.</b> Study as an example of the masque, keeping the dramatic
element prominent. Set the scenes, imagine stage accessories
suggested by the lines; such as, costumes, lights, tableaux, music.
Show differences between this and the fully developed drama. Do
the same kind of work as in “Paradise Lost” with fine thoughts and
beautiful expressions. Show the lyric element here and its appropriateness.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Lycidas.</b> Preface with the reading of examples of the classic pastoral
elegy, in order to familiarize students with the pastoral style
and so remove some of the difficulties. (See Baldwin’s “Famous
Elegies” for translations of Theocritus, Bion, and Moschus). This
poem has real difficulties for young students, therefore the teacher
must give wise assistance in mastering it, or it will fail to make an
appeal. Note the beautiful variation of melody. Show the effect of
alliterative and assonantal rhyme and the grouping and alternation
of consonant and vowel sounds, with resulting changes in music. At
the close of the study of the poem, make a comparative study of it
and Gray’s Elegy to show the difference between the personal and
the general elegy.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span><b>Alexander’s Feast.</b> Study (1) as an imitation of the heroic ode;
(2) as an example of effective wedding of sound and sense.</p>

character of the 18th century. (See “Social Life in the Reign of

Lock” as a picture of the times. Study the De Coverley Papers (1)
as a picture of the times; (2) for the character of Sir Roger and reasons

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span><b>Outline of Class Work.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>1. Origin and development of drama among the Greeks; study of
a play from the period of their highest literary achievement.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Brief consideration of the forerunners of the modern English
drama; (1) miracle plays, (2) moralities, (3) early English farces,
(4) pre-Shakespearean drama. Examples of types (2) and (4) studied.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Shakespearean Drama: study of one each of the comedy and
tragedy (those not studied in the regular English courses).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Brief review of the history of the drama from the beginning
of the 17th to the end of the 18th century. Study of one of the best
types of 18th century comedy.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Important phases of 19th century drama considered. Study
of a transition type.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. The contemporary drama; its broad range as to both matter
and manner opening great possibilities—of achievement for the dramatist,
of education for the audience.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Method.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>In accordance with the aims as stated, the technical side of the
work will, for the most part, be presented by the teacher in the form
of concise notes, in order to leave as much time as possible for direct,
appreciative study of plays.</p>

<p class='c009'>The collateral reading is to be used as illustrative material and
for comparison.</p>

<p class='c009'>Scenes will be studied and presented by students in the classroom,
with occasional public (school) presentations. Students realize dramatic
values by this means.</p>

<p class='c009'>Toward the end of the term, students will be encouraged to attempt
the construction of original plays or dramatization of parts
of novels and stories.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>WRITTEN COMPOSITION.</h4>

<p class='c014'>The work in composition is so planned as to draw help from the
literature course, but is not based upon it. One period a week in all
classes except Public Speaking and Dramatics is devoted to the work.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>General Suggestions.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>1. Work from the whole to the parts; that is, begin with the
whole composition, and work to the paragraph and sentence.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. While emphasizing in different terms some one particular kind
of composition, do not limit the work wholly to that form.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>3. Make the course cumulative; that is, refer to and emphasize,
wherever possible, principles learned in former terms.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. In all work, oral and written, whether formal compositions,
examinations or recitations, develop a feeling for organization and
arrangement of thoughts.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Encourage expression of the student’s interest, but try to
guide and broaden it. Seek to develop the power to observe accurately;
also to awaken the imagination.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Try constantly to enlarge the student’s vocabulary.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Insist on correct form, neatness and promptitude. Part of the
work of High School English is to form correct habits.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Make all criticisms constructive. Have as much personal conference
as possible.</p>

    <div>NINTH YEAR.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>First Term.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Special Work.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>1. Composition, chiefly narrative, but no special emphasis on
narrative as a form of discourse.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Punctuation.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Letter-writing.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Review of grammar.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Material.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>Reproductions of parts of literature read, reports on outside reading,
imaginative treatment of subjects suggested by the literature
lesson, personal experiences. The following will suggest possible
subjects: New nature myths, new hero stories, additional adventures
for Ulysses, stories illustrating his various traits of character, new
endings to old stories, possible settings for Homeric stories, dialogues
between Homeric characters, descriptions of scenes from the Iliad
from the point of view of an eye-witness, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Method.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>1. Teach from the beginning correct form and habits of neatness
and care. While emphasizing these, have most of the work reproductive,
in order not to kill spontaneity.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Emphasize letter-writing toward the end of the term when
the interest has been aroused in other forms of writing. Select for
practice only such letters as young people would be apt to write.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Begin systematic training in punctuation early, and continue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>with the composition work throughout the term. Teach the use of
the comma, quotation marks, especially in dialogue, and the terminal
marks. Teach by the logical rather than by the formal method;
that is, lead to the examination of the thought in sentences and to
punctuation in accordance with it.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. In review of grammar, use Hitchcock’s “Enlarged Practice
Book.” Select chapters treating of the general structure of a sentence,
the nature, kinds, and uses of phrases and clauses; also the
exercise on common errors of speech. Adapt this work to the special
needs of each class. One day a week will be taken for drill if necessary,
or it may be omitted, if classes are well prepared.</p>

<p class='c013'>Second Term.</p>

<p class='c009'>Begin the study of separate forms of discourse. Teach what
rhetoric is, and the reasons for studying it.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Special Work.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>1. Narration, with its involved problem of structure.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Continued drill on punctuation.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Continued drill in grammar if needed.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Method.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>1. Begin with narration. Teach during the term the essentials
of a successful narrative.</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>a.</dt>
    <dd>Action (something happening).
    </dd>
    <dt>b.</dt>
    <dd>Point (an idea, a climax).
    </dd>
    <dt>c.</dt>
    <dd>Unity (it must hang together).
    </dd>
    <dt>d.</dt>
    <dd>Style (it must be interesting and entertaining).
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c009'>Emphasize this kind of work while teaching narrative poetry and
prose (the novel), but do not draw subjects from the literature lesson.
From this term on, composition work should be original. (See
Sampson &amp; Holland’s Composition and Rhetoric for excellent suggestions
on teaching narration).</p>

<p class='c009'>2. While studying Ashmun’s “Prose Literature for Secondary
Schools,” follow the general line of composition work there suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Punctuation. Teach the use of the semicolon, colon, dash, and
exclamation point, and continue drill of preceding term.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Simple teaching of paragraph structure; that is, the grouping
of similar thoughts together by their relation to a central idea or
topic.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Toward the end of the term a brief review of letter-writing.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>TENTH YEAR.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>First Term.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Special Work.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>1. Description, with involved problem of diction.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Review of letter-writing.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Method.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>1. Begin with comparative work in two kinds of description:
scientific and literary; that for information and that for enjoyment.
Develop this by the primary essentials of descriptive writing:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>a.</dt>
    <dd>Point of view.
    </dd>
    <dt>b.</dt>
    <dd>Selection of details.
    </dd>
    <dt>c.</dt>
    <dd>Order and grouping.
    </dd>
    <dt>d.</dt>
    <dd>Objective and subjective character.
    </dd>
    <dt>e.</dt>
    <dd>Appropriate diction.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c009'>2. Notice of differences will involve a study of diction: synonyms,
especially adjectives; figures of speech (simile, metaphor,
and personification); words of color, sound, motion, shape, concrete
terms.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Use as illustrative material examples from scientific writing,
text-books, books of travel, novels, verse. Whenever possible, make
the literature lessons serve as models, but do not draw from them
for subjects. Have all composition original.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Later in the term return to narration, and combine with it
description of scenery and character.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Throw occasional compositions into the form of the friendly
letter, using some of the best modern letter writers, such as Stevenson,
as models.</p>

    <div>TENTH YEAR.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Second Term.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Special Work.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>1. Exposition, with involved problem of clearness and order.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Word-work, with the purpose of enlarging the vocabulary and
developing accuracy in the use of words.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Review of letter-writing.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Method.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>1. Connect with the preceding term’s work by showing that exposition
is description which explains; which shows the general and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the common rather than the particular and the individual; which
omits the personal.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Develop the following special points:</p>

<p class='c015'>Arrangement of material.</p>

  <dl class='dl_4'>
    <dt>A.</dt>
    <dd>Gathering of ideas, either one’s own or those from standard authorities. If the latter,
    give directions on note-taking.
    </dd>
    <dt>B.</dt>
    <dd>Selection of material, according to scale of treatment.
    </dd>
    <dt>C.</dt>

      </dd>
      <dt>c.</dt>
      <dd>Conclusion, with summary where advisable.
      </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c015'>Development of material (Paragraph making).</p>

<p class='c015'>Do no formal work with the paragraph except to teach the
importance of the topic sentence as a means toward unity and
therefore toward clearness. Insist on a clear topic sentence
for each paragraph. Permit any means of development that
naturally suggests itself. Encourage the attempt not only to
begin paragraphs well, but to end them well.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Word-work. Give regular exercises once a week for the first
half term on work tending to develop an interest in words and accuracy
in their use; such as, exercises in defining, in synonyms (select
only such as are apt to be misused), on words with interesting history.
In defining insist on correct form and clear distinctions. Vary
this work and select with care, so that it will be vital. It is valueless
if formal and perfunctory.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Review briefly business letters, and such social forms (invitations,
acceptances, regrets), as high school students will be apt to
need.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>ELEVENTH YEAR.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>First Term.</p>

<p class='c009'>The work of the Eleventh year is cumulative, continuing practice
in narration, description, and exposition, with new emphasis on
style.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Method.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>1. While studying the “Idylls of the King” and “Silas Marner,”
review narration and description. Insist on the observance of
principles learned in earlier terms, but try to arouse an interest in
style as a means of increasing effectiveness. Emphasize the difference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>between poetic and prose style, and the limitations of each.
Note the use of figurative language in modern prose style. Try to
develop the power of suggestiveness. Study the descriptions of place
and character in “Silas Marner” from this point of view, and try
to interest the class in attempts at imitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. While studying the essay, review exposition. Insist on attention
to points learned in the Tenth Year. Carry on paragraph development,
with more emphasis on various kinds of paragraphs; as,
transitional, summarizing, introductory, and concluding.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Give some attention to prose style, especially if Macaulay is
being studied. Show the value of various rhetorical forms; such as
the balanced sentence, loose and periodic sentences, studiously short
sentences, climax, rhetorical questions, also the value of concrete
terms. Try to interest students in imitating various styles.
Frequent short papers, in each of which some definite point is being
worked for, will bring better results both in interest and achievement
than less frequent long ones.</p>

<p class='c013'>Second Term.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Special Work.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>Continued review of narration, description, and exposition, with
emphasis on style.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Method.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>1. Make the review of the first two forms lead up to the writing
of a brief short story. Teach this at the same time the short story
and novel are being studied. Begin with writing of various settings,
introductions, descriptions of person and character, incidents introduced
for various purposes, bits of dialogue, and lead up to the complete
story.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. While reviewing exposition, draw subjects from questions of
present interest, either local or general, and occasionally from literature
work. Reports on collateral reading may be used to teach
the writing of a simple, interesting book review, that would lead
others to read. Choose subjects here that will not lead to copying
other peoples’ ideas. Reject empty, glittering generalities.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Have at least one longer piece of exposition this term than
has been previously written, preferably on subject of public interest.
Correct topical outline personally before the paper is written, showing
how it may be improved.</p>

<p class='c009'>Argumentation with involved problem of force and tact.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Method.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>1. Study the general nature of argument, the use of exposition
in argument, the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning,
the difference between assertion and proof, attack and refutation.
Be practical and not technical in this work. Choose subjects
calculated to stimulate thought on topics of the day; draw
as largely as possible from school life in order to demonstrate the
value of the work.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Emphasize the value of structure here as well as in pure exposition.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Practice in writing of speeches, in whole or in parts; openings,
refutations, conclusions, appeals to the feelings.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Show the value of appropriate style.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Vary the special work of the term by occasional papers on
topics suggested by the literature work, provided they are of live interest
and such as to provoke discussion.</p>

<p class='c009'>1. Review of the different forms of writing taught throughout
the course, to test power and to unify impressions.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Four longer papers than heretofore, one of each kind of discourse.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Briefer exercises are needed.</p>
<h4 class='c011'>ORAL COMPOSITION.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Definite practice in oral composition extends throughout the entire
course. At least once every five weeks each student talks to the
class on some subject previously prepared. Increase these exercises
whenever time will permit.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>General Directions.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>1. Have students stand before the class, free from desks or other
external support.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Subject matter should be prepared, but not memorized. Students
may use a small card with headings, but no other notes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>3. The length of the talk may vary from two to three minutes
in the Ninth Year, to five of six in succeeding terms, as ideas and
ease increase.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Material should be drawn from subjects outside the literature
lessons. Let the student’s interest determine the subject. Talks
may be reproductions of newspaper or magazine articles, of parts of
books, or accounts of personal experience, but the wording must be
the student’s own.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Teachers should emphasize constantly the same principles or
order and arrangement of ideas as in written work. The aim is not
mere talk, but effective speech.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Emphasize interest of the audience as a test of success. Try
to arouse an ambition to win this. Teach the gain to a speaker
from erect, free posture of the body, ease of manner, command of
the audience with the eye, clear enunciation, pleasant voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Criticism must be sympathetic and kindly, even when corrective.
Above all try to arouse ambition to succeed and the will to
persevere.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>NINTH YEAR.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Anecdotes, stories read, reports on topics connected with Greek
life may all be used. The talks may be varied by readings; for instance,
selections from Stephen Phillips’ “Ulysses,” read in parts;
an act of “Antigone,” or some other Greek play; poems illustrative
of the work being studied, or similar work bearing no relation to the
literature lessons. The aim is to develop ease and self possession in
standing before the class, and interest in trying to hold an audience.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>TENTH YEAR.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><b>Material.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>Accounts of interesting things seen or done; descriptions of famous
events, places of men; accounts of anything of current interest.
Try by the search for live material to broaden the students’ interests
and to make them more generally intelligent. This may be
helped by having suitable subjects for talks submitted every week,
even although time will not permit practice in talking that often.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>ELEVENTH YEAR.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><b>Material.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>Continue the work of the preceding year, with greater emphasis
on subjects of present interest. Seek to encourage intelligent reading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>of newspapers by reports on current events. More frequent practice
may be obtained by sometimes combining the oral composition
work of the second term with the literature work. Reports on authors
and works read outside of class, literary pilgrimages to interesting
places in America, occasional readings may all be utilized.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>TWELFTH YEAR.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><b>Material.</b></p>

<p class='c009'>Every Monday throughout the year have reports at the beginning
of the period, (1) on events of importance of the preceding week
outside of the United States; (2) in the United States outside of
California; (3) in California, especially local events of importance.
Insist on discriminating selection and judicious condensation. Have
subjects of importance expanded into special talks. Use also throughout
the year reports on topics suggested by the literature work.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>HISTORY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The work in this department has a two fold purpose, namely, training
and information. In the first place, the subject is taught with a
view to developing breadth of vision, judgment, and an understanding
of cause and effect in human affairs. Secondly, the aim is to
enable the student better to understand the conditions and problems
of the present day by knowing their historical connections. The
work is conducted with the constant realization that the highest use
of history is to prepare young people to discharge intelligently their
many duties as citizens in a democracy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The courses in the department are as follows:</p>

  <ul  class='ul_1'>
    <li><b>General History.</b> For 9th and 10th grade pupils.
    </li>
    <li><b>Ancient History.</b> For 9th grade pupils.
    </li>
    <li><b>Mediaeval and Modern History.</b> For 10th grade pupils.
    </li>
    <li><b>English History.</b> For 11th grade pupils.
    </li>
    <li><b>United States History and Civics.</b> For 12th grade pupils.
    </li>
    <li><b>Economics.</b> For 11th and 12th grade pupils.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4 class='c011'>General History.</h4>

<p class='c014'>This course presents, in the simplest way, an outline of the history
of our civilization, from its origin to the present day. It aims to
help the pupil to understand the causes, geographical, racial, etc.,
that have led to the rise and decline of nations, and to appreciate
the services that these peoples have rendered to mankind. Much attention
is given to the great characters of history. An especial effort
is made to know the origin and history of existing nations, and
to realize that the present is an outgrowth from the past. The course
is useful also in helping the pupil to grasp the time and place of the
characters and events that he meets in literature and science, and
thus it supplies a background for his other studies.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>Ancient History.</h4>

<p class='c014'>The courses in Ancient History and in Medieval and Modern History
together cover the same ground as the course in General History,
but do so more thoroughly and with much greater detail. They are
recommended to those who expect to take at least three years of
History in the high school. The course in Ancient History covers the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>period from the dawn of history to 800 A. D. It is designed to
give the pupil some knowledge of the origin of our civilization.
After a short discussion of prehistoric beginnings, a brief study is
made of the ancient oriental peoples. The major part of the course
is devoted to the history and civilization of Greece and Rome, with
especial reference to their influence on the life of the present day.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>Medieval and Modern History.</h4>

<p class='c014'>The course in Medieval and Modern History covers the period
from A. D. 800 to the present, and is a continuation of the course in
Ancient History. Its purpose is to trace the continued development
of our modern civilization, and to understand the origin and character
of the nations of today. Attention is devoted to economic
and social conditions, as well as to political events. Especial emphasis
is placed upon the period since Napoleon Bonaparte. A study
is made of the governments of the principal European nations, and
contemporary problems are discussed in the light of their history.
Considerable use is made of current newspapers and periodicals.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>English History.</h4>

<p class='c014'>The fundamental principles of our American government, the idea
of local independence, of jury trial, of representation, are traced
back to English institutions; showing at the same time that these
privileges are the result of the persistent contest waged for over six
hundred years, which struggle, in fact, is still going on. The conditions
in Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and on the Continent of Europe are
discussed in connection with the constitutional development, and the
economic, political, social, and religious conditions in England. The
British Empire is studied in its relation to the other nations of the
world, and in the economic and political condition of its colonies and
subjects.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>United States History and Civics.</h4>

<p class='c014'>The study of the earliest period is planned to show that the work
of discovery and exploration has been going on for over four centuries
and is still in progress. Economic, political, and religious conditions
in Europe are discussed, and related to conditions in America.
During the colonial period the principles and the traits which characterized
us now as a nation were developed. The importance of the
idea of local independence maintained by the colonists against the
idea of imperialism held by England is discussed, and followed by a
consideration of the significant facts of the Revolution and the process
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>by which the loose confederation of states became the constitutional
republic, tending toward a vigorous national growth. The
problems of transportation, the removal of the Indians, the disposal
of the public lands, the struggle of free and of slave labor for the
control of the territories, the Civil War; these subjects and others related
to them are treated, bearing in mind that today the United
States is no longer in isolation, but linked to other nations. The
study of the Constitution of the United States, and of the actual
workings of the city, state, and national governments, is designed to
bring out clearly that the citizen today has new duties and new responsibilities;
that the intelligent citizen should be informed concerning
the tariff, the trusts, the labor unions, equal suffrage, the
peace movement, and other current questions. The Constitution of
the State of California, and the Charter of the City of Oakland are
given special attention, and visits are made to the City Council, the
Board of Supervisors, the Courts, and the State Legislature.</p>

<h4 class='c011'>Economics.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Economics deals with the social activities and institutions
that result from men’s efforts to procure a livelihood. It
studies the means by which nations become rich, and the effects of
riches upon the public welfare. The policies of modern government
have so much to do with economics that an understanding of economic
laws is essential to wise citizenship. The aim of this course is to
teach enough of accepted economic theory to enable the student to
understand the laws that govern the larger economic questions of today.
Mere abstract theories, however, are avoided. A study is made
of the evolution of industrial society and the application of economic
laws. Emphasis is laid upon the study of consumption, i. e., the
best expenditure of the personal and public incomes, and on such
dominant questions as Labor, Tariff, Monopolies, Socialism, Taxation.
The student is led to realize that as the industrial and economic life
of today is the outgrowth of past tendencies, so the wise solution of
present vexed economic questions will determine the economic character
of the decades to come. Moreover, it is believed that the study
of economics, while dealing with matters of great practical importance,
tends also to quicken the love of justice and to encourage sanity
and moderation of view concerning the value of material wealth.</p>

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>NINTH YEAR.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c011'>Elementary Algebra.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Mechanical skill and accuracy of expression in the formal language
of Mathematics are the things emphasized in the first year of
Algebra. The course is designed to cover sufficient ground so that the
student who studies Algebra for only one year will be able to handle
the algebraic processes involved in problems of computation in
Geometry and to manipulate formulae, in order that he may read
intelligently the popular publications on mechanics. To this end
special attention is paid to graphical methods of representation, to
the solutions of simple equations in which the unknown may be
represented by any letter, and to the solution of the quadratic
equation, by the formula method as well as by factoring. Stress
is laid upon accuracy of expression, and upon the knowledge of
processes, that this elementary work may afford a proper foundation
for all future work in Mathematics. Factoring is taught by
means of type forms and rules, which the students are required to
learn.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following are the subjects considered: four fundamental operations,
linear equations, type product forms, factors, fractions, fractional
equations, ratio and proportion, quadratic equations, functionality,
simultaneous linear equations (graphical solution), simplification
of simple surds. The quadratic equation is used to develop
the idea of a variable and of a function of a variable, and to teach
graphical methods of solving equations. Stress is laid upon the
practical application of the graph to the solution of every day problems.</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c011'>Plane Geometry.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Usual theorems and constructions, original exercises, problems of
computation.</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c011'>Algebraic Theory.</h4>

<p class='c012'>First Term.</p>

<p class='c009'>The object of this course is to introduce the student to the
Theory of Mathematics; therefore the demonstration of principles
is insisted upon. A rigorous treatment of simple laws is required.</p>

<p class='c009'>The course is designed to meet the needs of two classes of students:
those who are preparing for the Engineering Course at the
University, and those who, while they are not preparing for college,
wish to do advanced work in Mathematics and to acquire a broader
knowledge of Algebra than that obtained in the first year. It also
prepares the students for the Courses in Trigonometry and Solid
Geometry that are to follow.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the benefit of those students who are not preparing for the
University and are not studying mathematics for its own sake, a
special effort is made to make the content of the course as rich as
possible; that is, to select topics that afford material for mathematical
thinking and at the same time have vocational value.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following are the subjects considered: factors, remainder
theorem, factor theorem, fractions, fractional and negative indices,
surds, and complex quantities (graphic treatment), theory of quadratic
equations, graphs, simultaneous equations, proportion and variation,
logarithms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Second Term.</p>

<p class='c009'>Either Solid Geometry or Trigonometry. These subjects are begun
but once a year. All students finishing two and a half years’
work in Mathematics may take whichever course is offered in the
second half of their third year. Original work and solution of
practical problems required.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>TWELFTH YEAR.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c013'>First Term.</p>

<p class='c009'>Either Solid Geometry or Trigonometry.</p>

<p class='c013'>Second Term.</p>

<p class='c009'>This course is a continuation of the work in Algebraic Theory
designed especially for engineering students and for others who wish
to continue advanced work. The student who is pursuing Mathematics
for its vocational value and who does not intend to go to
the University need not elect it, since the first term of Algebraic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Theory, with Solid Geometry and Trigonometry, will give him sufficient
equipment. The following topics are studied: synthetic division,
simultaneous quadratic equations, special methods for higher
equations, determinants, mathematical induction, binomial theorem,
summation of series.</p>

or 8 periods per week.</p>

<p class='c013'>First Term.</p>

<p class='c009'>A study of land forms based on field excursions to points easily
accessible afoot or on the street cars. Soil formation and conservation.
A study of the physical features of California with their economic
consequences, particularly the determination of the routes of
railroads, the choice and construction of harbors, quartz and placer
gold mining, the development of water power and long-distance electric
transmission, lumbering, irrigation, agriculture, horticulture, etc.
Tarr’s New Physical Geography, pages 13–172, liberally supplemented
by the use of reference books, lantern slides, relief models and topographic
maps. Wright’s Manual of Physical Geography.</p>

<p class='c013'>Second Term.</p>

<p class='c009'>A study of the simpler elements of weather and climate based on
astronomic and other observations and on certain physical and chemical
experiments. A study of the great wind belts of the world and
regions of excessive, moderate, or deficient rainfall, locating each
regionally in the continents. The climatic regions of the United
States with particular reference to temperatures, prevailing winds,
and rainfall—each as modified by physiographic features and by
large bodies of water. A regional study of the United States with
particular reference to milling, stock feeding, dairying, slaughtering
and packing, iron, coal, lumber. Centers of manufacture with a
consideration of methods and lines of transportation both by land
and sea, particularly of the transcontinental lines which reach the
Pacific Coast. Possible changes on the Pacific Coast due to the
opening of the Panama Canal. Tarr’s New Physical Geography,
pages 1–12 and 173–430, supplemented by the use of reference books,
individual full-mounted globes, wall maps, weather maps, and excursions
to the Chabot Observatory and the United States Weather
Bureau. Wright’s Manual of Physical Geography.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Botany.</b> Regularly a tenth year subject; but may be taken in
the ninth year. Time: 8 periods per week, including double laboratory
periods. Laboratory and recitation periods are arranged to suit
the topic under consideration.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>The text used in Bergen’s Essentials of Botany. In the main, the
order of topics as there given is followed. More experiments in plant
physiology are taken than are outlined in the text, and some time
is devoted to the study of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon,
including the chemistry of combustion. About 24 weeks are devoted
to the study of seed plants, and 18 weeks to spore plants. Enough
time is devoted to the study of the classification of seed plants to
enable a pupil to use a key readily. An herbarium is not required;
but the necessary instruction is given, and the pupil is encouraged in
the preparation of one if he shows interest in this kind of work. In
the study of spore plants particular attention is given to bacteria,
yeasts and molds in their relation to household affairs.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Zoology.</b> Regularly an eleventh year subject. Time: 7 or 8
periods per week, including double laboratory periods. It is expected
that only one class will be organized in each year, this class
to begin with the fall term.</p>

<p class='c013'>First Term.</p>

<p class='c009'>Invertebrate zoology, with comparative study of typical forms,
e. g., amoeba, paramoecium, sponge, hydra, sea-anaemone, starfish,
earthworm, shrimp, crab, etc. Special attention is given to beneficial
and injurious insects.</p>

<p class='c013'>Second Term.</p>

<p class='c009'>Vertebrate zoology, with comparative study of human anatomy
and physiology. Detailed laboratory study of the anatomy of the

terms; Conn and Budington’s <b>Advanced Physiology</b>, second term.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Physiology, Hygiene and Sanitation.</b> Regularly an eleventh year
subject. Time: 7 or 8 periods per week, including double laboratory
periods.</p>

<p class='c009'>The course is intended to contribute as much as possible toward
healthful living. The study of structure and function is made the
basis of an intelligent appreciation of the principles of hygiene.
The conception of the body as a mechanism which requires new materials
of definite kinds to replace worn out parts, and which also
requires a constant supply of energy to enable it to do its work is
made the basis of the study of food materials and the principles of
dietetics. The course concludes with a study of the nature of infectious
and contagious diseases and the means by which they are
communicated; and domestic and public sanitation.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Text-books: Conn and Budington’s <b>Advanced Physiology</b> and
Brown’s <b>Physiology for the Laboratory</b>.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Chemistry.</b> Regularly an eleventh year subject. Previous preparation
should include at least one-half year of algebra; but the chemistry
may be taken without it. Time: 7 or 8 periods per week, with
double laboratory periods.</p>

<p class='c009'>General Chemistry. The subject essentially as presented in McPherson
and Henderson’s <b>Elementary Study of Chemistry</b> and <b>Laboratory
Exercises in Chemistry</b> by the same authors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Household Chemistry. This is alternative with the general course
in the second half year. The work of the first half year is the same
as in the general course. The course in household chemistry is intended
for girls, and substitutes the chemical problems and processes
of the home for those of the mine, the smelter, and the metallurgical
and chemical industries in general. Large use is made of a
reference library of works in the chemistry of cooking, cleaning and
sanitation. Blanchard’s <b>Household Chemistry</b> is used as a laboratory
guide.</p>

<p class='c009'>The credit toward graduation and the college entrance credit is
the same for the household chemistry as for the general course.</p>

<p class='c009'><b>Physics.</b> Brief Course. Regularly a twelfth year subject. Minimum
preparation, 8 units, including first year algebra and the first
term of plane geometry. Time: One period daily for one year.
Credit: One unit.</p>

<p class='c009'>This course fulfils the requirements in science for admission to
the College of General Culture, the College of Commerce, and the
General Course in Agriculture of the University of California, and for
similar courses in other universities. It emphasizes the qualitative
aspects of phenomena, omits the more difficult mathematics of the
subject, takes fewer quantitative laboratory experiments and devotes
less time to practical applications than the full course does. Astronomical
topics are introduced here and there as they fit into the regular
order of the work.</p>

<p class='c009'>Full Course. Regularly a twelfth year subject. Minimum preparation:
10 units, including first year algebra and plane geometry.
Time: 3 single periods and 2 double periods per week in the first
half year; 2 single periods and 3 double periods per week in the second
half year. Credit: One and one-half units.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>The full course is prescribed in the fourth year for all pupils preparing
for the Colleges of Mechanics, Mining, Civil Engineering,
Chemistry, and the Technical Course in Agriculture of the University
of California, and for similar courses in other universities. It is elective
for all other pupils who have the necessary preparation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The full and the brief courses are given in separate classes, in
either or both terms, when the number of students enrolled necessitates
the organization of more than one class in the work of the
term. When the classes are not thus divided, the pupils in the full
course will take the work with the brief course class 5 periods per
week, and will take additional work as a separate class 2 periods per
week in the first term, and 3 periods per week in the second term.</p>

<p class='c009'>Text-books: Coleman’s <b>Text-book of Physics</b>, and Coleman’s <b>New

<h4 class='c011'>University Admission Requirements in Science.</h4>

<p class='c014'>The University of California requires for admission at least one
science given in the third or fourth year of the high school course.
Physiology, Zoology, Chemistry, or Physics fulfils this requirement;
Botany does not, but it receives regular admission credit as an elective
subject. When Botany is offered together with any one of the
other sciences, both receive admission credit, the one as an elective,
the other as the prescribed third or fourth year science.</p>

<p class='c014'>1. One year of gymnasium work taken twice a week is required
of all high school students. No unit credit is given for this alone.
Athletic work, however, is taken throughout the four years, the
equivalent of two periods a week—part gymnasium and part outdoor
work—for which one unit is given towards graduation. For the first
semester of the tenth year, a compulsory course in Hygiene is substituted
for active work in the physical education department. A
yearly medical and physical examination is required.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. After the first term, if the work is deferred for a year or
more, the first term must be repeated; for the required year’s work
is to be continuous.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Girls’ Department—Gymnasium work consists of breathing
exercises, free work, dumb bells, wands, Indian clubs, chest weights,
mat work, folk dancing, and marching, with special emphasis laid on
graceful carriage. Out door athletics—baseball, basket ball, volley
ball, tennis, and playground games.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. The regulation costume for girls’ class work consists of:</p>

all the normal functions of the body—care of the infant and house;
care of the sick; public sanitation, such as prevention of infectious
diseases, garbage and sewage disposal; care of food in the home and
supervision of dairies and markets, and federal activities in control
of public health.</p>

<p class='c009'>A medical examination is made of every freshman girl during her

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
